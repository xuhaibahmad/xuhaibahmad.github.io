<p><b>M</b>y interest in mobile application development stemmed from my passion for game development. Between developing mobile apps and playing video games, I admittedly spend most of my time in front of a screen. Some of my passions are learning new technologies, watching sci-fi movies, reading books, writing clean code, creating productive apps and filling up a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
 
<p>I am a passionate and curiosity-driven Computer Science graduate having more than 3 yearsâ€™ hands-on experience of freelance software development. I like building software that adds value to people's lives. Be it a mobile application helping them finding their best deals in town or a video game providing some quality entertainment after an exhausting day. It brings real satisfaction knowing that a piece of software that I "invented" made someone's life better in some way.</p>
 
<p>After devoting last 4 years learning and working on professional projects as a freelance developer with most of the widely used technologies, having several successful projects on the freelance market, Play Store and a long-running partnership with an International Startup; currently seeking experience and reputation in the discipline with new ideas in contemplation. Moreover, exploring opportunities for Social Entrepreneurship.</p>
