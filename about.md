<p>I'm a passionate and curiosity-driven Software Engineer with {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2015 }} years of experience and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Currently working in Taiwan, as an Android Enginer at <a href="http://www.sodalabs.co/">Sodalabs</a></p>

<p>My interest in mobile application development stemmed from my passion for video games. Between developing mobile apps and playing games, I admittedly spend most of my time in front of a screen. Some of my passions are learning new technologies, writing clean code, reading, watching sci-fi movies, and filling up a fresh cup of coffee.</p>

<p>From developing mobile applications for a living to automation projects as a hobby, I have spent the last several years exploring various genres and paradigms of information technology working along with countless brilliant minds. My journey so far has included contributions to projects with international as well as local clients both as a team member and an individual contractor.</p>

<p>After having several successful projects on the freelance market, long-running partnerships with several clients around the world and being part of a bunch of brilliant teams in some amazing organizations; currently building the next generation of Smart DOOH Media products. Moreover, exploring opportunities for social entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Also, I'm available on the weekends for non-profit and open source contributions. Feel free to contact me if you need assistance with any project dedicated to a social cause. ðŸ™‚</p>
