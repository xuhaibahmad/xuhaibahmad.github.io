Raffle Hunter is a marketing tool that makes it easy for customers to find and engage with businesses through raffle events. The app lets businesses set up raffles for events such as Tradeshows, conferences, other industry events, while customers can participate with just a scan of a QR code.

I joined the project as sole Android Engineer midway through the development and worked on it for few months leading to beta release.
