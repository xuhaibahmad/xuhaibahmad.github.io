[Sparkpoint](https://www.sparkpointgroup.com/){:target="_blank"} is a DOOH product jointly owned by [Sodalabs](https://sodalabs.co/){:target="_blank"}. The idea is to increase sales by providing customers actionable and engaging content through a digital kiosk.

The core requirement of the project is to replace the default Android launcher with a custom interface that is locked on to our advertisement player application. On top of that, the engineering team has to build a stable infrastructure for content creation and continuous delivery mechanism through Over-the-Air updates.

Like most of the customer engagement platforms, a big part of the product is to collect all sorts of metrics to measure impact. In addition to traditional conversion based metrics tracking, we also make use of facial recognition to anonymously track user behavior for sentiment analysis.
