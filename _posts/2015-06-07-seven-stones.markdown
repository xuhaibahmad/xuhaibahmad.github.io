Seven Stones 3D was built as part of Term Proeject for the course of Computer Graphics. The game was a 3D implementation of casual subcontinent game Seven Stones using Unity3D.

Although the game turn out to be incomplete and broken at the project submission date but luckily that half cooked work was sufficient to get me through the semester. Then life happened and this project stayed in the list of procastinated projects that never saw the light of day.
