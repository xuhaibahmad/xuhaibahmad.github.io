The project is a minimalist weather app built as part of a portfolio item. The main purpose of this project is to learn Flutter and apply best practices to it.

The project uses [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) for state managment, [Auto Route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route) for routing and [Injectable](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable) for dependency injection.
