The Leanback library is quite limited when it comes to building Netflix-style catalog, specially the fixed pointer navigation for Android TV. FlixView attempts to overcome the complexity by mixing RecyclerView with Leanback's VerticalGridView to build similar experience.

You can find the library on [Github](https://github.com/xuhaibahmad/FlixView).<br/>
