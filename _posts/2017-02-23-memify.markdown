Few days back, while searching for an API, I found this other one that let's you generate meme's via REST API calls. So this weekend I decided to use my spare time and turn it into a fun application. It took just a few hours from start to production and most importantly added a new item to my portfolio to showcase \*wink\*. If you want to check it out, find the link at the bottom of the post.

**Memify** is a simple meme generator that lets you create memes in just 3 simple steps:

1. Choose a meme
2. Add your text
3. Hit the Generate button

That's it! You have your meme. Share it with your friends and have a good laugh together.
